- The system should handle the transition between the signals smoothly, ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow 
- The system should be able to detect and handle emergency situtations, like ambulance and fire truck 
- The system should be scalable and extensible to support additional features and functionality 

**Classes, Interfaces, and Enums**
- The Signal enum reepresents the different states of traffic light: red, yellow, green 
- The road class represents a road in the traffic control system 
- The TrafficLight class represents a traffic light, with properties like ID, current signal, duration of each signal state etc
